Trie
====
University project.

Given a text file. The task is to print all the words with maximum different characters.

The solutions is to scan text word by word. 
To calculate different chars in the word we use binary search tree instead of array of HashMap (for studing purpose).
Every word with maximum different chars we stor in trie (to get rid of dublicates).
